# Conclusion

This was an interesting challenge. Learning how to recreating a running
operating system with only being able to read files taught me some useful
techniques for testing other systems. I see it as attempting to map the
contents of a room, but the only visibility the mapper has is peering 
through a keyhole. I don't know how close my recreation matches the actual
environment used by the Challenge, but I'd like to think it is very close.

I'll close with a 'Thank you!' to everyone at [SANS](https://www.sans.org/)
and [Counter Hack](https://www.counterhack.com/) for producing this every year. 
A special 'thank you' to Ed, for reaching out when I wasn't sure I was even
going to participate this year. May you find an actual [Coney Dog](https://www.eater.com/2016/5/8/11612056/detroit-coney-dogs-history) somewhere near you.
